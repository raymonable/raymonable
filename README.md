# Hi! I'm Raymond.

I am a self-taught programmer in highschool. I do webdev work in languages / systems such as TypeScript and Svelte. I also like to work in real-world-applicable languages such as C++, primarily taking interest in the WebAssembly scene.

I also have been learning Blender for 3 years as a secondary hobby. Maybe if this webdev thing doesn't work out, I can do 3D character modelling for Zenless Zone Zero or something.
