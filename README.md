# Hi! I'm Raymond.

I am a self-taught programmer and by technicality a "certified IT technician"â€”**I got my CompTIA 1101/1102 A+ recently! :confetti_ball:**<br>
I prefer working on webdev, but I'm branching out and doing backend and non-web software development as well.

[I had to remove all of the icons I used because GitHub changed something about the markdown viewer and every icon was humungous. Sigh]
