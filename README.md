# Hi! I'm Raymond.

I am a self-taught programmer and a senior in high school (12th grade). I do webdev work in languages / systems such as TypeScript and Svelte. I also like to work in real-world-applicable languages such as C++, primarily taking interest in the WebAssembly scene. I also enjoy graphics programming projects but I often get stuck in the initial phases.

I also have been learning Blender for around 3 years as a secondary hobby. Maybe if this webdev thing doesn't work out, I can do 3D character modelling for Zenless Zone Zero or something, Hahaha ha ha <img style="height: 1.5em" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5e6d238-c853-438e-a9d5-aabc22b01d8b" />
